Addition:
  1. Shift until exponent matches (increase smallest)
  2. Add (this is a regular add I think)
  3. Normalize result by shifting value and exponent
  4. Check for over/underflow
  5. Follow rounding rules and round result
  (6.) Check if result needs to be re-normalized (only 9's in result)

Multiplication:
  1. Add the exponents (biased versions (+127) - 127)
  2. Multiply significands
    - Add number of bits to the right of the decimal point for the result
  3. Normalize, check for over/underflow
  4. Round. Normalized? If not goto 3
  5. Sign it, if sign of operands are different, its negative, otherwise positive
