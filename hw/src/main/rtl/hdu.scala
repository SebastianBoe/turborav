// Purely combinatorial Hazard Detection Unit (HDU)

// The HDU collects information from the different stages that could
// lead to a bubble and then distributes stall signals
// accordingly. When stalling, a pipeline stage should not modify it's
// pipeline register, and it should send a bubble to the next stage.

// In addition to stall signals the HDU generates flush signals. When
// a pipeline stage is flushed it should clear it's pipeline register,
// but not send a bubble to the next stage.
