This is the TurboRav full computer stack hobby project.

The end goal is a self-contained system consisting of a RISC-V
processor core, assembler, compiler, and some graphical demo apps
running on top. This can be considered an exercise in extreme Not
Invented Here Syndrome.

Although third-party code-reuse is non-existant in this project, the
use of external tools strives to be bleeding edge. Haskell is the
chosen language for the compiler and Chisel as a Hardware Description
Language.
